# User Account Deletion Functionality

## Overview

A comprehensive user account deletion feature has been implemented in the UserProfile component, allowing clients to permanently delete their accounts and all associated data.

## Features

### üöÄ **Complete Account Deletion**

- Deletes user account from server (if registered user)
- Clears all local data (localStorage)
- Removes order history and preferences
- Resets application state

### üîí **Safety Measures**

- **Confirmation Dialog**: Double confirmation before deletion
- **Clear Warning**: Explains what will be deleted
- **Loading State**: Shows deletion progress
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling with user feedback

### üé® **User Experience**

- Beautiful confirmation dialog with warning icon
- Clear explanation of consequences
- Order count display in confirmation
- Smooth animations and transitions

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified

#### 1. `src/util/userDataUtil.ts`

Added new utility functions:

- `clearUserData()`: Removes user data from localStorage
- `hasUserData()`: Checks if user has local data

#### 2. `src/components/user/UserProfile.tsx`

Enhanced with deletion functionality:

- Delete account button in ProfileHeader
- Confirmation dialog with detailed warning
- Async deletion handler with proper error handling

### Key Functions

#### `handleDeleteAccount()`

```typescript
const handleDeleteAccount = async () => {
  setIsDeleting(true);
  try {
    // Delete from server if real user
    if (user.id !== "guest" && typeof user.id === "number") {
      await deleteUser(user.id);
    }

    // Clear local data
    clearUserData();
    clearOrders();

    // Success feedback and reload
    toast.success("Your account has been successfully deleted");
    onHide();
    setTimeout(() => window.location.reload(), 1000);
  } catch (error) {
    toast.error("Failed to delete account. Please try again.");
  } finally {
    setIsDeleting(false);
    setShowDeleteConfirm(false);
  }
};
```

## User Flow

### 1. **Access Delete Function**

- User opens their profile
- Sees "Delete Account" button in red styling
- Button is located next to "Edit Profile" in ProfileHeader

### 2. **Confirmation Process**

- Click triggers confirmation dialog
- Dialog shows:
  - Warning icon and title
  - List of data to be deleted
  - Order count
  - "Cannot be undone" warning
  - Two action buttons

### 3. **Deletion Process**

- User confirms deletion
- Loading state shows "Deleting..."
- Server deletion (if applicable)
- Local data cleanup
- Success message
- App state reset with page reload

### 4. **Error Handling**

- Network errors are caught
- User-friendly error messages
- Dialog remains open for retry
- No partial deletion states

## UI Components

### Delete Button

```tsx
<Button
  icon={<Trash2 className="w-4 h-4" />}
  label="Delete Account"
  className="bg-red-500/80 hover:bg-red-600/90 border-red-500/50 text-white backdrop-blur-sm transition-all duration-300 rounded-xl px-6 py-3"
  size="small"
  onClick={() => setShowDeleteConfirm(true)}
  disabled={isDeleting}
/>
```

### Confirmation Dialog

- Uses PrimeReact ConfirmDialog
- Custom message with warning icon
- Lists specific data to be deleted
- Shows current order count
- Styled accept/reject buttons

## Dependencies

### New Imports Added

```typescript
import { ConfirmDialog } from "primereact/confirmdialog";
import { Trash2, AlertTriangle } from "lucide-react";
import { clearUserData } from "@src/util/userDataUtil";
import { deleteUser } from "@src/api/service/user.service";
import { toast } from "sonner";
```

### State Management

```typescript
const [showDeleteConfirm, setShowDeleteConfirm] = useState(false);
const [isDeleting, setIsDeleting] = useState(false);
const clearOrders = orderStore((state) => state.clearOrders);
```

## Security Considerations

### 1. **Server-Side Validation**

- The `deleteUser()` API call handles server-side deletion
- Proper authentication required for API access
- User can only delete their own account

### 2. **Data Cleanup**

- All localStorage data is cleared
- Order store is reset
- Page reload ensures complete state reset

### 3. **User Verification**

- Only applies to non-guest users for server deletion
- Guest users can clear local data only

## Benefits

### For Users

- **Full Control**: Complete ownership of their data
- **Privacy**: Ability to remove all traces
- **Transparency**: Clear understanding of what gets deleted
- **Safety**: Multiple confirmations prevent accidental deletion

### For Developers

- **Clean Architecture**: Modular deletion logic
- **Error Resilience**: Proper error handling
- **State Management**: Clean state cleanup
- **Reusable**: Easy to extend or modify

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

The functionality is automatically available in the UserProfile component when a user has placed orders (hasProfile = true).

### Testing

1. Place some orders to see the ProfileHeader
2. Click "Delete Account" button
3. Review the confirmation dialog
4. Test both "Cancel" and "Delete" flows
5. Verify complete data cleanup

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements

1. **Soft Delete**: Option to temporarily deactivate instead of permanent deletion
2. **Data Export**: Allow users to download their data before deletion
3. **Partial Deletion**: Let users choose what data to keep/delete
4. **Admin Override**: Admin ability to prevent certain deletions
5. **Audit Log**: Track deletion requests for compliance

### Technical Enhancements

1. **Batch Operations**: Handle multiple user deletions efficiently
2. **Background Jobs**: Move heavy deletion operations to background
3. **Data Retention**: Implement retention policies for legal compliance
4. **Recovery Window**: Brief period where deletion can be undone
