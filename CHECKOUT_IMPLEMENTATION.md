# Checkout Flow Implementation

## Overview

I've successfully implemented the checkout flow with the requested features:

### New Components Created:

1. **CheckoutForm** (`src/pages/site/home/components/forms/CheckoutForm.tsx`)

   - Form with required fields: telegram_id, telegram_username, phone_number, address
   - Form validation using React Hook Form and Zod
   - Submit and Clear buttons
   - Loading state during submission

2. **MyOrders** (`src/pages/site/home/components/MyOrders.tsx`)
   - Displays all user orders
   - Order details view
   - Order status tracking
   - Responsive design

### Updated Components:

1. **CartIcon** (`src/pages/site/home/components/CartIcon.tsx`)
   - Added checkout form integration
   - Added MyOrders integration
   - Modified checkout flow to show form before order creation
   - Added "My Orders" button in cart footer

## How It Works:

### Checkout Flow:

1. User clicks "Checkout" button in shopping cart
2. CheckoutForm dialog opens with required fields:
   - Telegram ID (required)
   - Telegram Username (required)
   - Phone Number (required)
   - Delivery Address (required)
3. User fills form and clicks "Submit Order"
4. Order is created with customer information
5. Cart is cleared
6. Success message shown
7. MyOrders dialog opens automatically
8. Order appears in MyOrders list

### Form Features:

- **Validation**: All fields are required with proper error messages
- **Clear Button**: Resets all form fields
- **Cancel Button**: Closes the form without saving
- **Loading State**: Prevents multiple submissions

### MyOrders Features:

- Shows all customer orders
- Order status badges (Pending, Confirmed, Preparing, Ready, Delivered, Cancelled)
- Order details with items, pricing, and customer info
- Savings calculation display
- Responsive design

## Integration Points:

1. **Form Data Integration**: Customer info from checkout form is stored with order
2. **Order Management**: Orders are stored in Zustand state and persist across sessions
3. **User Experience**: Smooth flow from cart → checkout → order confirmation → order history

## Technical Implementation:

- **TypeScript**: Full type safety
- **Form Validation**: Zod schema validation
- **State Management**: Zustand for cart and orders
- **UI Components**: PrimeReact components
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Toast Notifications**: Success/error feedback

The implementation is complete and ready to use. Users can now:

1. Add items to cart
2. Review cart contents
3. Fill out checkout form with their details
4. Submit orders with customer information
5. View their order history in MyOrders
